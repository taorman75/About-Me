# Responsive-Bootstrap-Based-Site (https://taorman75.github.io/About-Me/)
A responsive site built with Bootstrap elements. This is an autobiographical site with three pages: Home, Portfolio, and Contact. As my skills progress, more content will be created for this site. 

## Contents

Created the following files:
* index.html
* portfolio.html
* contact.html
* README.md
* reset.css
* style.css
* Assets folder (to contain images)

Website includes:
* a NavBar
* a sticky footer
* a responsive grid-based layout
* responsive images
* working links
* a contact-me form
